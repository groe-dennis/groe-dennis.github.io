Hi, I'm Dennis. 

I like:

- Artificial Intelligence. I've been interested in the topic since high school and have been hyped about it since a least GPT-2. Some of my blog posts are about ideas related to  Artificial Intelligence.
- Meditation: I've been meditating regularly for a few years now. I think meditation is great and more people should give it a try. I'm a fan of Michael Taft.
- Hiking: I love hiking


My journey:

- I studied Computer Science at the University of Karlsruhe for my Bachelor's
- I did an awesome exchange semester in Korea at the Seoul National University during my Bachelor's
- I studied Cognitive Science at the University of Tuebingen for my Master's
- I did an awesome exchange semester in Taiwan at the National Taiwan University during my Master's
- Now I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at SprintEins in Stuttgart
