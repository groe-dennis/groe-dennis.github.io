# Complete analysis in terms of shamata and vipassana
Everything can be explained in shamata and vipassana (like with expansion/contraction, self/other, negative/positive). Different perspecitves that can sometimes be usefull. In terms of shamata and vipassana, its that shamata is the unifing element and vipassana is the dividing element. Both are needed (for skillfull progression in meditation)

# Neural networks
Neural networks (not unlike the brain but maybe even more capabale) work by creating representations. representations are nothing else than differentiating input in a skillfull way. Ie divide all input to be either dog or cat. 


# Do neural network also do shamata?
Shamata can be described as the unification of different parts of the brain/mind. Is this process also happening in neural networks?

# How can the division of neural networks be used in meditative training?
